    <div id="main-header">About SPRINGRUNNERS</div>
    <div id="text">Springrunners is a platforming game where the objective is to 
        make it through various levels without being launched from the Wall of Springs 
        that chases the player. The game was influenced by a game called Speedrunners, a 
        multiplayer platforming game where each player tries to get ahead of the others 
        so that the other players go off of the screen and die. We wanted to make a game
        that had the same fast-platforming aspect of Speedrunners while being unique, so we 
        decided to go for a singleplayer platformer with various new mechanics not present in Speedrunners
        such as a higher jump, a grapple you can use while in radius, and a piston to force the player
        to navigate the levels quickly.
